I’m a single mom. I’ve been saving for this trip since January this year. And I’m being told I won’t get a refund because the flight isn’t cancelled but I also won’t know if it’s cancelled until the day before.

While on the line with the baggage team, I was told it was American Airlines fault even though Air Canada never delivered the bag to them. 48 hours later, Air Canada is still working with American on exactly where my bag is. The major issue is Air Canada has essentially 0 employee presence in Indianapolis airport for these situations. Also, I didn't even try to book an Air Canada flight. I booked through United and they happened to book me on Air Canada. Indianapolis airport says this seems to be an issue with Air Canada on being unsupportive.

Making baggage claim so late (by not sending a team to a flight that had been delayed then cancelled over ten hours) that it was impossible to book a hotel. Vaguely saying ""we'll give you a voucher"" and bailing on you. No real updates. Why not cancel the flight earlier, or release our baggage? Was it worth the slim shot at saving the $600 for passenger comp? Sending baggage onwards without checking in or asking. I waited 4 hours to make sure my baggage is secure, only to have it shipped in front of me ruining the whole point. In two separate points. One agent telling me that they don't care in domestic about bags, so keep it tight with you (why I stayed an extra 4 hours or so) - just to have Air Canada say YOLO and ship it onwards. Not even having the presence of mind to hand out food, food vouchers, anything after passengers were placed in a hot plane, deplaned, and made to stand for 10 hours+. This could have been the easiest token. Having super long lines at every step of the process and being understaffed. For example, the baggage claim line had three people at the counter, and one person checking or doing something while dozens of passengers were waiting in line. Full hands on deck? Not the case with Air Canada, by understaffing. I generally blame management for putting staff and passengers in this situation - that said, some staff members were supremely unhelpful in a way that boggles the mind. Why even make gate announcements if you work for the company and literally have no better idea than any of us what is going on? Is checking who is ""priority"" really the best way you can use your time given a baggage line that runs hours on average? Is it impossible to anticipate a situation like this and having agents be reachable in some way? Not a great time to have only 2-3 people operate a counter when the line is like 800 deep? One thing that stood out is that this seemed uniquely bad for Air Canada. This is very surprising, because airlines like Flair and Westjet have much worse reputations.

Then, to top it off, they lost our luggage again for 1 day on our return trip (home). No incidentals incurred this time, but we got our $35 luggage fee back on that one too but within reasonable time. Both of those fees should be refunded immediately without the extra work of filing out forms online, then waiting before receiving. That was our first trip with Air Canada.

Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Calgary to Washington DC via Toronto,2024-07-01,3.0,3.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1," AIR CANADA decided on the spot to cancel the connecting flight from Toronto to Washington DC on July 17th 2024 afternoon. When arriving to Toronto from Calgary on July 17th, the connecting flight was on the board saying ""on-time"". About one hour before the scheduled departure, it changed to ""delay 30 min"" and about 20 minutes later changed again to ""flight cancelled"". Checking at the gate what's going on, AIR CANADA person told us there is a weather issue - this why the flight is cancelled. The weather that afternoon in Toronto was perfect! Checking later what was the weather in the destination airport - DCA, shows that at the timeframe we were suppose to arrive to DCA (between 6 pm to 12 pm) about 15 -20 other flights from different airlines arrived and landed safely - so there was no significant major weather blocking this flight from taking place due to weather at the destination either. This was a complete fake excuse made by AIR CANADA, not to operate this flight. Obviously nobody from AIR CANADA gives any explanation or a proof. They just announce it and we - the passengers - can do nothing about it. But - this was only the beginning. Air CANADA didn't offer any solution for this flight passengers, no compensation, no hotel, no meal - not even a glass of water. The option given was to take this flight after 28 hours from the original departure time (just for part of the people - others got nothing). Actually, they kind of ""celebrated"" the event. ""This is a Weather case, so we owe nothing to the passengers, this is our regulations, good luck for you"" Anyway, this was just a one hour flight +/-, so we decided to rent a car and drive the 8 hours distance and took a hotel for a night sleep on the way, since we had hard obligations for the next day in Washington DC. The rudest and most annoying response from Air CANADA after all this, is that they refuse to pay back the extra expenses taken by us to reach our destination, due to this irresponsible and unloyalty behaviour of AIR CANADA. Bottom line - AIR CANADA has cancelled a flight on the spot without any justified reason, without giving a reasonable alternative solution and refuse to pay back any compensation or expense to the passengers.",air-canada,Detractor

Whenever possible, I chose Air Canada for my journeys. However, I have observed a decline in the quality of service. Regrettably, I have noticed that the attentiveness and politeness of the flight attendants have diminished. In comparison to other airlines I have traveled with, such as Qatar Airways, Lufthansa, KLM, Turkish Airlines, Korean Air, British Airways, and various American carriers, Air Canada's service has not been up to par. My recent experience with Lufthansa was particularly pleasant; the crew treated passengers with genuine smiles and excellent service. In contrast, Air Canada's flight attendants display a demeanor that suggests they view themselves as victims, and this attitude unfortunately affects their interactions with passengers. For instance, during a recent flight, there was turbulence, and the captain announced that hot beverages would not be served due to safety concerns, and the seatbelt sign was illuminated. When the seatbelt sign was later turned off, a flight attendant approached to offer drinks. I mentioned that I would like a coffee but was aware that hot beverages were not being served due to the turbulence. Instead of a polite clarification, the attendant responded with, ""Can't you see the seatbelt light came off?"" Her words were laced with sarcasm, which I found quite unpleasant. As a result of these experiences, I have decided to choose other airlines for my future travels. My wife and I will be traveling to Europe this October, and we have chosen not to fly with Air Canada.

The stewards seemed unorganized, did not say anything to us about the exit row protocol and took up to half hour to respond to the call button. The snacks were dry-as-sawdust pretzels, and the beer was warm. The headphone plugs did not work and the fold-up monitor would not rise up to be seen from my seat.

They keep on offering to go to Terrace or Smithers which is way far away to my destination. They did told me to book a hotel and place a complaint for reimbursement but there is no guarantee of reimbursement.

This cancellation caused me to miss all my connecting flights to a trip to Peru which cost me over $3000 to rebook on the day of all my missed flights. Cancellation due to weather was a lie as the communications line to Whitehorse had been severed and therefore, they cancelled the flight because they could not access their systems (can prove this with news stories). This was confirmed by Air Canada Employees at the airport when half of the plane showed up to check in at 3 AM. However, since they had used weather as the cause for cancellation they would not help me cover any of my rebooking costs as they say that they can't control the weather. What's even worse is that they are allowed to change the initial reason for cancelling the flight to something other than weather (like no access to their systems) but because the initial reasoning was weather, they can still avoid responsibility and doing the right thing. Air North was fantastic and was the only reason I was able to make it to Vancouver to rebook my entire trip.

On the business portion from YVR-HKG the entertainment system and screen malfunctioned including constantly turning on in a dark cabin while most were trying to sleep. I book business class for 3 reasons, comfort of seat, entertainment value, and meal/in-flight service. When one of these 3 services is not provided then I am no longer satisfied with the fees I paid for this class of travel. The Head-purser tried to reset a number of times then 2 flight attendants spent all kinds of time taping 2 cushions to the screen. My return flight in Premium was no better. Although I had paid $5700 for my flight and the passenger next to me $6000 for his round-trip YVR-HKG in Premium both of us were informed early on we wouldn't have a choice of meals as the Vegetarian was the only option left. While I have experienced this same problem a few years back on Air Canada I really can't believe this airline can't put enough meals on board to offer the selection they advertise. Unlike business, there was no option days before to select the meal you want and alleviate this entire issue. They absolutely treat this class (Premium) like standard economy although they now charge a multiplier of 3-3.5 times the standard economy cost. Wake up Air Canada! In the end I was offered $150 credit for my troubles and after going back to them again and again they have refused to show more compassion. With the offer of a $150 coupon they are basically suggesting I would have paid for this business class travel @ a price of $5700 with an offer of ""minus $150"" but no entertainment service. Would anyone book that class of travel if they were told of this full ticket price minus $150 because you will not be providing any entertainment? In addition to the absence of entertainment my comfort was significantly disrupted because of a screen turning on frequently with full brightness in a darkened (resting) cabin.

I flew over 30 hours from Sydney to London, via 12 hours layover in Delhi. This is unacceptable. On top of that, the toilets were disgusting, smelly, unkempt (eg sticky floors) and insecure - the bored flight attendants had a common habit of banging on the doors whilst in use and opening them from the outside, even when they were in use and there was no queue of people waiting to use them.

There was no issue while boarding the flight as both the ground crew as well the cabin crew were very kind and responsive. But the main issue began in the aircraft where my seat 17F, a window seat, had a broken handle and a loose tray table which in my opinion would have come off with a slight increase in force. Apart from this the aircraft had a bad odor which made me uncomfortable. For the rest of the flight, I faced no issue and the food was good along with the cheerful cabin crew, but my bad opinion on Air India further increased when the flight landed in Delhi, it took almost 30-40 mins of waiting in the aircraft just to deplane after the plane came to a complete stop because of improper communication which lead to a lot of unrest among the passengers leading to a chaotic deplaning experience.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Melbourne to Hyderabad via Delhi,2024-05-01,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2,no,1,"  My recent experience with Air India on a long-haul flight from Melbourne to Hyderabad was nothing short of a nightmare. From start to finish, the journey was marred by a series of disappointments and discomforts that left me deeply dissatisfied.  The food served was not only of poor quality, but it was also presented in a manner that suggested utter disregard for basic hygiene standards. Packages were not just messy inside but also had spills all over the exterior, making the already unappetizing meals even less appealing. To add insult to injury, the taste was abysmal, and the quality of desserts was subpar, failing to meet even the most basic expectations. Moving on to the condition of the aircraft itself, the state of the toilets was deplorable. Broken toilet doors and malfunctioning facilities resulted in a pervasive stench that permeated the seating area, creating an incredibly unpleasant atmosphere for passengers. It's unacceptable to subject paying customers to such unsanitary conditions. Furthermore, the lack of inflight entertainment for a significant portion of the seats is simply inexcusable in this day and age. With technology readily available, there's no reason why passengers should be deprived of this basic amenity, especially during a lengthy 20-hour flight. Speaking of discomfort, the seating arrangements were far from satisfactory. Uncomfortable seats made the already arduous journey even more taxing, leaving passengers feeling physically strained and restless. And if the in-flight experience wasn't bad enough, the ordeal continued upon arrival at Delhi airport. The mishandling of baggage collection, with staff carelessly pulling out bags from the belt and haphazardly placing them outside, created chaos and confusion among passengers trying to locate their belongings. In conclusion, my experience with Air India was nothing short of a disaster from start to finish. The combination of poor food quality, unsanitary conditions, lack of entertainment, uncomfortable seating, and chaotic baggage handling has left me with a strong resolve never to fly with them again. It's truly disappointing to see such a renowned airline fall so far below acceptable standards, and I urge prospective passengers to think twice before considering Air India for their travels.",air-india,Detractor

Air New Zealand has to be the worst in condescending service and unnecessary process. I’m writing this review after 5 flights with them in the last 10 days (and unfortunately another 3 to go). The boarding process is peculiar with word choices such as “you can board when invited”. To be clear I wait till I’m called and don’t understand the notion of people jumping queues. But the word choice of invite is the first passive aggressive experience as part of the flight experience A week ago I flew Air NZ and for the first time in my life I was reprimanded by the hostess for not watching (I was listening) the in flight safety. I told her I’m listening and she said “well you should watch” Checking in today my bag was 32.7kg. I appreciate there needs to be a limit, but there’s no discretion. I’m flying business class for a three week trip. I then removed a few items and the scale said 32.0kg. I was then told it has to be under 32 which necessitated me to refute that point. Grudgingly, the person then put the case through and gave me the *sigh* treatment. Getting onto the flight, the first thing the host says is the incoming flight’s passengers “ was a 9 out of 10, so you have a high standard to live up to”. Whilst I 100% understand this was meant in humour, it’s symptomatic of an airline that doesn’t want to serve. These experiences alongside poor food on the flights, no pyjamas on overnight business and frankly the weirdest business class layout with no privacy makes this an airline to avoid. Unless of course you want to feel like you’re being done a favour for something you paid for. It’s relatively good value for money (at prices that are still stubbornly high) but you need to take into consideration the places they skimp on.

Unfortunately again I am disappointed. Flight to Tokyo was delayed due to technical condition of the plane. Return- cancelled with no support (no alternative flight, explanation, etc). Helpline not working. Eventually I managed to book a flight with Quantas to avoid being stuck in Tokyo on my own cost - good I have insurance. Never again as in previous flights to NY ANZ did similar thing.",air-new-zealand,Detractor
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Auckland to GIsborne,2024-01-01,1.0,2.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1," My son was on NZ8161 to Gisborne on 15/1/24. We PAID extra as he was an unaccompanied minor - Harlan Pere. Hes 11 [his brother was travelling with him but he is 13]. Checked in for the flight at special assistance as normal. Flight was slightly delayed. Then flight was called. Lined the boys up in the line but was very surprised as all their previous flights - [a couple of times a year for the last several years] unaccompanied minors have been called first. EVERY SINGLE TIME! When the boys got to the gate and swiped their boarding passes, that's when the gate agent realised there was a minor on the flight. Kelly, the most unprofessional, rude and disgustingly inept gate agent I have ever met, then decided the boys needed to stand to the side and be boarded last. THIS HAS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE! When we queried why they weren't called first Kelly informed me that Air NZ never calls for unaccompanied minors before a flight and she had never done this in her 8 years working there. THIS IS A LIE! When I asked to speak to a supervisor she said she was the supervisor. When I asked for someone higher up to make a complaint Kelly told me she was the highest person. When I asked for the name of her supervisor so I could make a complaint she refused to give me this information as well as her last name. All of this was getting very loud - she was just as loud, and I had to tell her several times to listen to what I was saying and not talk over me. At this stage there is approx 200 people in the AIR NZ departure lounge listening to this heated discussion. As well as the boys who were confused why there were being held back. No one explained it to them from Air NZ. I went back to the Special assistance desk and they pointed me to the Premium check in desk and I spoke to Marianne - Team Manager - who listened and confirmed that Kellys behaviour, attitude and customer service was abysmal. Several people I don't know came up to me after and said it was shocking and I should complain about Kelly and her incompetent service. Mariana did her best to listen but Kelly is disgraceful. I have paid extra for this service, been lied to, been yelled at, been dismissed and made to feel like we were the issue as we didnt bring him up sooner when we were never informed by Special Assistance this was now a requirement. If the policy has changed [which Mariana confirmed hadn't] or Kelly didn't pick up there were unaccompanied Minors on the flight all she had to do was apologise and say a mistake was made. Not flat out argue and lie in front of 200 people that she was right and MINORS HAVE NEVER BEEN called in her 8 years doing the job.",air-new-zealand,Detractor
